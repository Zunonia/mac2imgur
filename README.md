A simple and snappy way to automatically upload screenshots to imgur!

---

###Installation Instructions###

[Download](https://github.com/rauix/mac2imgur/releases) a release, then simply drop it into your 'Applications' folder.

---

###Usage###

#####Press **CMD + SHIFT + 4** to take a selection of the screen.#####

#####Press **CMD + SHIFT + 3** to take a full-screen screenshot.#####

After you've taken a screenshot, you'll notice that the icon in your system tray will turn either green or red.

If it turns green, then your screenshot has successfully been uploaded and the link has been copied to your clipboard.

If it turns red, for whatever reason, that means the screenshot upload failed - try taking it again!
